# Hydrogen: The Dance Of Creation
## A Zen bullet hell jam game


This is a Game Maker Studio game that I created over the course of 96 (albeit I only spent under 12 on this one as far as work load goes as I had difficulties finding a concept that I liked for the theme) hours in late 2021 for the GMC community game jam #43.

[See result topic on the forum](https://forum.yoyogames.com/index.php?threads/gmc-jam-43-results.91928/#post-555560)

The game ended up in 14th place out of 18.

As with most jam games this project was put together incredibly quickly under stressful circumstances, 
and the code quality reflects that. It's not intended to be good or well written code wise, 
all it needed was to work more often than not once sent out to the world.
